# MV-warpedMF-SI
MV-warpedMF-SI is a multi-view matrix factorisation model that jointly learns a warping function for each data view and efficiently incorporates the side information of the relatedness between rows (e.g. gene similarity) and columns (e.g. disease similarity) during decomposing the data matrices.
